# Music-Assignment

My music assignment is an audio player, which you can play songs and adjust them using the sliders provided. These sliders change the volume and pitch of each song. There are six songs in total, with each having its own button. While music is playing, the edges pulsate in response to the music. This is some really awesome visual feedback that I wanted to include. It really engages the user and encourages them to play with the sliders, as the pulsating edges change as the pitch and volume change. The theme is a jazz theme, as that is a kind of music that I really like. It also sounds very nice when fiddling with the pitch slider, unlike some other forms of music in my opinion. With jazz, changing the pitch can envoke different emotions. Slowing it down can make a more somber tone, whereas pitching it up makes it more joyous and upbeat. Using the audio player is very easy and approachable for anyone to use, with only a few simple buttons that play when you click them and stop when you click them again. The buttons have text on them to tell the user weather clicking the button will play the song or stop it. As previously mentioned, there are also a few sliders that give the music some customization without being too complex.
